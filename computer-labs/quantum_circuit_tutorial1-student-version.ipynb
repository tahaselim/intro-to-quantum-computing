    "Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. It is a phenomenon where two or more qubits are correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit is coupled with the state of the other qubit. In other words, measuring one qubit will instantly determine the state of the other qubit, regardless of the distance between them. This is a simple definition of entanglement. However, a more precise definition of entanglement will come later in the upcoming tutorials."
